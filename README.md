# THE REDONGLER™
## a current project, under development, for people to be able to repurpose their old mice/keyboards/peripherals and dongles into something they can reuse again.
effectively aims to give new life to tons and tons of e-waste headed for a landfill. just because companies have made it so hard to replace/repurpose old mice, keyboards, and dongles, doesn't mean we should accept that as the norm.
